This is a small application I built in Java that has two main parts: a login and a Japanese flashcard deck app. It uses java.swing for basic GUI, Firebase authenication for login, and Google Cloud Run for deployment.
Users can create accounts, get a reset password link for forget password, login, and practice the two Japanese alphabets (Hiragana and Katakana).
